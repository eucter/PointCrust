# PointCrust

PointCrust is a WebGL tool, based on three.js library, that converts a point cloud dataset to a triangle mesh structure. Berger et al. present a nice review on state of the art methods for surface reconstruction from point clouds. There are web tools for point cloud to mesh approximation such as MeshLab, however there is no dedicated tool for this task. As an example, MeshLab is a general tool for meshes and its web version is currently in beta, lacking a user friendly interface. PointCrust is designed as a user-friendly and dedicated point cloud to mesh tool for the web. Mesh approximation is based on marching cubes which can easily be extended to include others. Also, it includes an additional coloring step which counts as an advantage over alternative tools.

# Installation

This is a standalone version. Unzip the file and then open index.html in a browser. Chrome might not work because of strict security. Microsoft Edge works.
Otherwise you need to use the localhost solution.
